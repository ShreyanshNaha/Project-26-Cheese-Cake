Cheesecake is a sweet dessert consisting of one or more layers. The main, and thickest, layer consists of a mixture of a soft, fresh cheese, eggs, and sugar. If there is a bottom layer, it most often consists of a crust or base made from crushed cookies, graham crackers, pastry, or sometimes sponge cake.Cheesecake is a rich dessert dish made with cheese, typically cream cheese, although cottage cheese or even sour cream may be used, depending on the recipe. The texture of this dessert is extremely rich and creamy, and the taste can range from sweet to highly tangy. In some places, cheesecake takes the form of a savory tart, rather than a dessert food.
